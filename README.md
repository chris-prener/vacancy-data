### Overview
This repository contains data releases from the [*Urban Prairies* Project](https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers). It currently contains tabular data for our 2017 analysis of vacancy in St. Louis, Missouri. There are both high and low estimate files containing the `HANDLE` identification numbers for parcels we determined to contain either vacant lots or vacant buildings. Details on our methodology are available in our forthcoming publication in the *Journal of Urban Affairs*, which is available as a pre-print on [SocArXiv](https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BC7EH). For more information, please check our [project website](https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers).

## About the *Urban Prairies* Project
### Project Description
The City of St. Louis (which is an independent city separate from St. Louis County) has a [well documented](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/amid-drumbeat-from-falling-bricks-st-louis-to-ramp-up/article_1e237c9c-95e7-5c01-8d0c-92a2fe1a5c78.html) pattern of extensive vacancy. What is less well documented, however, is the volume of vacancy in the city. A variety of estimates have been made in the last several decades. Most recently, the Mayor's office release an estimate of at least 24,000 vacant properties as part of the City's [Preliminary Resilience Assessment](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/initiatives/resilience/documents/upload/PRA1001_Report_Inside_10.pdf). Our *Urban Prairies* project aims to produce estimates of vacancy at the parcel level in St. Louis. We are particularly interested in how vacant land clusters spatially to produce areas in St. Louis that appear to 'return to nature'.

### Principal Investigators
**Christopher Prener, Ph.D.** is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Sociology and Anthropology](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/sociology-anthropology/index.php) at [Saint Louis University](http://wwww.slu.edu). In addition to spearheading the *Streets Not Thru* project, he is currently working on a book manuscript entitled *Medicine at the Margins*.

Chris is also part of a research team examining the effects of literacy on mental health service use and recovery. More details about his research and teaching are available at [his website](https://chris-prener.github.io) and he can be contacted at [chris.prener@slu.edu](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu).
