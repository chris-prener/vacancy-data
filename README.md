### Overview
This repository contains data releases from the [*Streets Not Thru* Project](https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers). It currently contains point locations for all known current and historic street closures in `.csv`, `.shp`, and `.geoJSON` formats. You can preview these data both [here](https://github.com/chris-prener/barriers-data/blob/master/location-data/geoJSON/STL_BARRIERS_All.geojson) and on [our website](https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers/barriers/).

## About the *Streets Not Thru* Project
### Project Description
The City of St. Louis (which is an independent city separate from St. Louis County) has a tremendously fractured street grid, with a variety of physical structures used to create cul-de-sacs or otherwise block traffic from using streets. However, precisely how fractured the city's street grid is remains an open question - [the City does not keep a list of closures](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/in-a-city-where-street-closings-are-common-schoemehl-pots/article_c191cf1a-4967-5f58-80f4-3d8e3189790f.html). The [*Streets Not Thru* Project](https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers) began as an effort to document the number of street closures in the city. We have since expanded our efforts to include research studying the demographic patterns that gave rise to the barriers, their effectiveness as crime deterrents, and the consequences of closed streets.

### Principal Investigators

The book examines the effect of neighborhood context and conditions on emergency medical services work, particularly with patients who have mental illnesses or substance use disorders. Chris is also part of a research team examining the effects of literacy on mental health service use and recovery. More details about his research and teaching are available at [his website](https://chris-prener.github.io) and he can be contacted at [chris.prener@slu.edu](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu).
