# Contributing to These Data
Since this repository is part of a research project, contributions are welcome
but may not be accepted if they do not contribute to our research goals.
Contributions are particularly in one or more of the following areas:

### Omissions
If you believe you have found a missing barrier or have additional details
about a barrier that is included in our release, please let us know by
opening an issue.

### Typos
If you have found a typo in the data, please open an issue and clearly
identify where the typo is.

### Suggestions
Suggested modifications to the data, such as proposed additions or extensions,
are all welcome. Please note that we will prioritize suggestions based on
our own research priorities and their fit with our research aims.

## Before Opening an Issue
Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/chris-prener/vacancy-data/issues)
to make sure the bug or typo hasn't been reported and/or already fixed.
Similarly, search to make sure someone has not already made a suggestion. If
there is a suggestion and you want to express support for it, please comment
in the existing issue.

By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can
[edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply
remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

## Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to
abide by its terms.
